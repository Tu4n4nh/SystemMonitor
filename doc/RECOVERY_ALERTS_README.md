# Recovery Email Alerts - Enhanced Feature

## Overview
The SystemMonitor now includes **Recovery Email Alerts** - a comprehensive feature that notifies operators when system resources return to normal levels after an alert was sent. This provides complete incident lifecycle visibility.

## How Recovery Alerts Work

### Alert Lifecycle
1. **Problem Detection** â†’ High resource usage triggers initial alert email
2. **Monitoring Continues** â†’ SystemMonitor tracks resource levels
3. **Recovery Detection** â†’ Resources return below thresholds
4. **Recovery Confirmation** â†’ System stays normal for specified duration  
5. **Recovery Alert Sent** â†’ "All Clear" email with analysis

### Configuration Settings

```properties
# Recovery Alert Settings
EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true           # Enable recovery notifications
EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS=120      # How long normal before "all clear"
```

## Complete Email Alert Flow

### Step 1: Initial Alert
```
Time 0:00 - CPU exceeds threshold (20%)
Time 5:00 - Alert email sent (after 5-minute duration)
Subject: "SystemMonitor Alert: Resource Thresholds Exceeded"
```

### Step 2: Recovery Detection  
```
Time 8:00 - CPU drops below threshold
Time 10:00 - Recovery email sent (after 2-minute normal duration)
Subject: "SystemMonitor Recovery: All Systems Normal"
```

## Recovery Email Content

The recovery email includes:

### Status Information
- **Recovery timestamp** - When normal operation was detected
- **Recovery duration** - How long system has been normal
- **Original alert summary** - Reference to the initial problem

### System Analysis
- **Current normal state** - Recent logs showing healthy operation
- **Recovery confirmation** - Verification that thresholds are no longer exceeded
- **Performance metrics** - Current resource usage levels

### Incident Summary
- **Problem duration** - How long the original issue lasted
- **Recovery time** - Time to resolution
- **Root cause hints** - What processes were involved

## Configuration Examples

### Production Environment (Recommended)
```properties
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_ALERT_DURATION_SECONDS=300      # 5-minute problem detection
EMAIL_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=60             # 1-hour between problem alerts
EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true       # Send recovery notifications
EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS=120   # 2-minute normal confirmation
```

### High-Sensitivity Environment
```properties
EMAIL_ALERT_DURATION_SECONDS=120      # 2-minute problem detection
EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS=60    # 1-minute normal confirmation
EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true
```

### Conservative Environment
```properties
EMAIL_ALERT_DURATION_SECONDS=600      # 10-minute problem detection
EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS=300   # 5-minute normal confirmation
EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true
```

## Sample Recovery Email

```
Subject: SystemMonitor Recovery: All Systems Normal

SYSTEM MONITOR RECOVERY ALERT
==============================

Recovery Detected: 2025-08-02 14:45:00
Recovery Duration: 120 seconds below thresholds
Original Alert Period: 12 log entries
Recovery Period: 8 log entries

SYSTEM STATUS: ALL CLEAR
=========================
âœ… All system resources have returned to normal levels
âœ… Thresholds no longer exceeded  
âœ… System performance stabilized

RECOVERY ANALYSIS:
==================
Recent system state showing normal operation:

--- Recovery Log Entry 1 ---
CPU: 15.2%, RAM: 65.1%, Disk: 2.3%
Active processes operating within normal parameters

--- Recovery Log Entry 2 ---
CPU: 12.8%, RAM: 62.4%, Disk: 1.8%
System load decreased, performance optimized

ORIGINAL ALERT SUMMARY:
=======================
For reference, the original alert was triggered by:
High CPU usage (85%) sustained for 5+ minutes
Memory pressure from multiple applications

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. âœ… System monitoring continues normally
2. âœ… Performance issue appears resolved
3. ðŸ“Š Review logs to understand what caused the original issue
4. ðŸ”§ Consider preventive measures if this was a recurring problem

This recovery alert was automatically generated by SystemMonitor.
Normal monitoring and alerting will resume.
```

## Benefits

### Complete Incident Visibility
- **Problem detection** - Know when issues start
- **Problem resolution** - Know when issues are resolved
- **Incident duration** - Understand impact timeline
- **Recovery confirmation** - Verify system stability

### Operational Excellence
- **Faster response** - Clear problem/resolution notifications
- **Better documentation** - Complete incident history in email
- **Reduced uncertainty** - Know when to stop investigating
- **Performance trends** - Track problem and recovery patterns

### Team Coordination
- **Status updates** - Keep all operators informed
- **Shift handoffs** - Clear incident status
- **Escalation decisions** - Know when problems are resolved
- **Post-incident review** - Complete timeline for analysis

## Settings Explained

### `EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true`
- **Purpose**: Enable/disable recovery email notifications
- **Default**: `true` (recommended)
- **When to disable**: If you only want problem alerts, not recovery notifications

### `EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS=120`  
- **Purpose**: How long system must be normal before sending "all clear"
- **Default**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Reasoning**: Ensures system is genuinely stable, not just temporarily normal
- **Tuning**: 
  - **Shorter (60s)**: Faster recovery notifications, risk of false "all clear"
  - **Longer (300s)**: More confident recovery, slower notifications

## Alert State Management

The system tracks these states:
1. **Normal** - No alerts, monitoring continues
2. **Threshold Exceeded** - Problem detected, counting duration
3. **Alert Sent** - Problem email sent, monitoring for recovery
4. **Recovery Detected** - Below thresholds, counting normal duration  
5. **Recovery Confirmed** - Recovery email sent, back to normal

## Integration with Existing Alerts

- **Cooldown still applies** - Recovery emails don't reset cooldown period
- **Problem detection unchanged** - Same logic for initial alerts
- **Log analysis enhanced** - Both problem and recovery logs included
- **Multiple recipients** - Recovery emails go to same recipient list

## Troubleshooting

### No Recovery Emails Received
1. Check `EMAIL_SEND_RECOVERY_ALERTS=true`
2. Verify initial alert was actually sent
3. Confirm system stayed below thresholds for full recovery duration
4. Check email logs for delivery issues

### Recovery Emails Too Frequent
- Increase `EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS` 
- Check if thresholds are borderline (oscillating above/below)
- Consider adjusting monitoring thresholds

### Recovery Emails Too Slow
- Decrease `EMAIL_RECOVERY_DURATION_SECONDS`
- Balance between speed and reliability
- Monitor for false "all clear" emails

This enhancement provides complete incident lifecycle management, giving operators full visibility into both problem detection and resolution! ðŸŽ¯âœ…
